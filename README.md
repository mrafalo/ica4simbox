# SIM Box detection using ICA and divergnce measures

Repository prepared for the conference publication: *SIM Box Fraud Detection by Deep Learning System with ICA and Beta Divergence*.


The scripts include the implementation of:

* Independent Components Analysis (ICA)
* Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance
* Frobenius norm
* Itakura-Saito divergence
